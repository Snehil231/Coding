        //Arithematic Operators:-
       // int a = 8; 
       // int b = 10 % a;
       //4.7%1.1----->Returns Decimal Remainders
       
       // % is the modulus operator, which gives the remainder of a division operation.for example, 10 % 8 equals 2 because when 10 is divided by 8, the quotient is 1 and the remainder is 2.

       //Assignment Operators:-
      /*  int c = 5;
        c += 10;
        System.out.println(c); */
        
        //Comparision Operators:-
       // System.out.println(a==b);// == is the equality operator, which checks if two values are equal.

       // System.out.println(b);
      //System.out.println(65>4);//comparison operator .

        //Logical Operators:-
        //System.out.println(64>10 && 64 >15);// && is the logical AND operator, which returns true if both operands are true.example, 64>10 && 64 >15 returns true because both conditions are true.

      //  System.out.println(64>10 && 64 <15);//Example, 64>10 && 64 <15 returns false because the second condition is false.

      //  System.out.println(64>10 || 64 < 5);// || is the logical OR operator, which returns true if at least one of the operands is true. Example, 64>10 || 64 < 5 returns true because the first condition is true.
